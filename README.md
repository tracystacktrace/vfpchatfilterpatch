# VFPChatFilterPatch

VFP (ViaFabricPlus) ChatFilter Patch is a small modification that aims to patch some specific places at ViaFabricPlus and its libraries (esp. ViaLegacy) in order to fix some issues related to processing chat filter from client side. This is essential for some ancient mc versions servers where they have either disabled filter of font.txt or have custom one (Cyrillic support, etc.).

This is, as ViaFabricPlus, a client-only mod.
